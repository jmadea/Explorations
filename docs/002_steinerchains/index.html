<h1>Exploration 002: Steiner Chains</h2>

<p>In this Exploration, we're going to play with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steiner_chain">Steiner chains</a>.</p>

<p>
As the Wikipedia article explains, a Steiner chain is a set of circles that are tangent to two non-intersecting circles 
and where each circle in the chain is tangent to its neighbors. There are many arrangements of circles that meet these 
requirements. We're going begin our Exploration with the simplest of Steiner chains: annular Steiner chains. These are 
closed chains, which means that the first and last circle in the chain are tangent to each other. Additionally, the 
circles in annular Steiner chains are of equal size. Annular chains are tangent to inner and outer concentric circles.
